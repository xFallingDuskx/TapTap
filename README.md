# TapTap

A game where users tap a button as fast as they can within set intervals (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds). Scores, which are based on the average number of taps/second, are automatically recorded after each round. The user and time limit can be changed after round ends.  

Based upon the [Passanger Counting](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) app from Scrimba and modified to fit personal interests.

Final result can be viewed [here](https://xfallingduskx.github.io/TapTap/).
