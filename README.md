# TapTap

A game where users tap a button as fast as they can within set intervals (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds). Scores can be recorded during the session (when the app is running). User and time limit can be changed after current round ends.  

Based upon the [Passanger Counting](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) app from Scrimba and modified.
